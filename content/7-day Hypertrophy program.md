**How much muscle can you even gain in 7 days?**
With Muscle memory, I might be able to gain abit of muscle in a short period of time, not a lot. 

**Why do I want to do this anyway?**
Well who doesn't want to gain some muscle?
But that's not the main reason for me.
I want to commit to strength training on a deeper level and bring that energy with me into the new year. 
My uncle always used to say that physical training should be as routine as brushing your teeth in the morning â€” a matter of physiological hygiene
If I could truly integrate it into my lifestyle in that way, I wonder what I would look and feel like in a few years?  

I start today - 26th December 2024 and I end on the 3rd of January , right before my flight to Lombok to start the New year in the best way - on Holiday.
