I first ran this program 12 years ago. I was 15 years old and it was a great introduction to the weightroom. 
I was consistent for a few months but moved on to a bro-split(Push pull legs) type of program which I did inconsistently for a couple of years before stopping for good. For the next decade, I would be mostly inactive apart from my time in the army, or when I was preparing for hiking trips. 
Today, being an engineer in Tech. I also sit for 10 or more hours a day. Which means I've been living quite a sedentary lifestyle. 
Stiff, out-of-shape with progressive joint pains because of inactivity, I start this program again, in hopes to develop a decent level of strength and help with injury prevention as I also ease back into Muay Thai training after more than a decade(more on that here), and importantly, make fitness a part of my lifestyle again. 

**The Program:** 
Stronglifts is a linear progression program where you increase the weight every training session until you hit a plateu. You then repeat the exercise with the same weight the next time, instead of increasing it. You keep progressing like this until you stall three times in a row, at which point you deload the stalled lift by taking 10% of the weight off the bar and working back up in the same way. 

That is my understanding of the program based on my experience. If you want to do it the way it was intended, please read the articles on https://stronglifts.com/  . I will stick to doing it the way understand it, as long as I see progress. 
There are a range of programs to choose from, I'm going with Stronglifts Lite, which is a lower volume alternative to the original 5x5 program, intended for recovery-limited individuals. It also helps that the workout can be completed in little time, which means getting it done in the morning before work is feasible and I'm more likely to be consistent. 


**Purpose:**
My primary goal with this program is to increase strength, and also to build the habit of lifting regularly again. 
Hypertrophy would be nice bonus, but its not the primary focus(I'd be running a higher volume program if the main goal was size). The primary focus is on strength and injury prevention. Practicing the Discipline that comes with running a program consistently, committing to it and seeing that I get the most out of it. 



**The Plan** 
I plan to run this program for as long as I see strength gains and my joint's are not negatively impacted. 
I will be logging my progress monthly right here under *[Weightroom Logs]* 
Along with this strength program, I'm also doing the *[Limber 11]* routine everyday to work on my lower body flexibility.
My Roadwork is tracked here  *[Roadwork]*
